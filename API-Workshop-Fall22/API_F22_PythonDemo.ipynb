    "1. The ability to run Jupyter notebooks. This can either be done through the Binder link found on the readme (and if you're viewing this document inside the Binder web app right now, you're already good to go!), or by [installing Jupyter on your own computer](https://jupyter.org/install) and opening this file there.\n",

    "In data science, there are often some common tasks that we frequently find ourselves doing. Repeatedly writing code for these common tasks would be tiring and inconvenient. For example, when using the vanilla Twitter API, the commands can change from just a few lines to tens and tens of lines that involves things like importing a lot of libraries, more authentication, selecting end points, and managing less readable outputs (see for yourself: https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code). Imagine having to do all of that every time we wanted to gather some tweets!\n",
