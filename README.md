Repository for the API Workshop Series held through the Cornell Center for Social Sciences. This GitHub repo contains the materials for a three-part series that introduces grad students, faculty, and staff to the common uses and practical applications of application programming interfaces (APIs). 

#### API Workshop 2: Jupyter Lab (Python) and RStudio Environments
Below are links to Jupyter Lab, which will be used for Python folks, and for RStudio. These are web-based instances and will work well for this workshop.
